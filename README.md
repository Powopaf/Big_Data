# Big_Data

## The idea

We will do a app (for ubuntu) that will produce graph, heat maps, ... 
The app will fectch the data on it's own.

## To start:
you must create your own python virtual env at the root of the project to use the app
then just do `sudo ./install.sh` to install the app and then you are free to go
do `sudo ./unsinstall` do uninstall the app
