# Big_Data

## The idea

We will do a app (line command in linux/windows) that will produce graph, heat maps, ... 
The app will fectch the data on it's own.

## Tech use

<warning>Can change</warning>
The code will be in python. We will use the `polars` librairy to do the query on the data base.

2. `git branch` to know on witch branch you are
3. `git checkout -b <branch name>` to create a branch
4. open your pull request in draft mode when you do the first push on your branch
    everyone can see what you are doing and can help you on your code
5. `git checkout <branch name>` or `git swich <branch name>` to swich branch (do
